Cloudformation was used to build both the netwroking and hardware infrastructure on AWS.

#### In this infra.yml file you can see all the networking:
- VPC
- Internet Gateways
- Nat gateways
- public subnets
- private subnets
- Routing and routing rules
- security groups

All of this is modular based no hardcoding anything for seamless creation and destroying.
